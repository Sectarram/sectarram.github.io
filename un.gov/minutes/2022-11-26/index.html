Hdavid from TIU calls for many problems to be fixed, before they can cause more war, demonstrating by mentioning Albania. Pumpking from TIU backs this up by saying their small population cannot survive a war.

Bucket from Vinland / the Emer Union advocates for more international laws and punishments. Spartan from TIU propose a sort of Geneva Convention to create laws that all nations must follow. The table proposes plans to create a prison on the spawn island. Hdavid from TIU proposes the prison to be in Zilbra, but this motion is rejected.

Spartan from TIU talks about the amount of rogue barbarians nations have had to deal with since our arrival on Sectarram. He mentions Mesarcu's previous burning of Osada. He agrees with the motion for more laws and punishments. He proposes that punishable laws should be decided by invididual nations. Bucket from Vinland / the Emer Union rebuttles by saying that laws should apply in all countries. After Spartan's counter argument, Bucket agrees with him.

The table discusses what slavery and human trafficking constitutes as. They decide that stealing a villager from another country is punishable, but trading villagers is allowed. Spartan from TIU motions that villager theft gets a punishment of 1-3 days in prison. The table agrees, and the motion is passed.

EpicRaisin from Flotekya / the Emer Union proposes a Free Roam Act, forcing cities to allow villagers to roam on their own. After voting, the table agrees to encourage it, but not enforce it.

Neighbor from Mesarcu notes how railways, which are quickly replacing boats, are beneficial.

At this point, Reni from Vinland / the Emer Union proceeds to attack Neighbor. He is dealt with, but allowed to continue in the meeting.

Spartan from TIU proposes a global railway system. This motion is not fully agreed one. with votes being split. Reni says that countries should be allowed to do whatever they want to people travelling on rails in their territory. Spartan rebuttles by claiming that on rails going between countries, you cant do any harm to people on them.

Renis claims that the USA has been terrorizing Vinland citizens at the border. He proposes an aid fund to help stop instability in the USA. At first the table is for this, until Reni says the fund will be for Vinland. The table then becomes negative towards the motion. Reni wants rails to not go to countries such as Nvidia and Poland, to stop criminals. The table is mixed about this, but they end up allowing the motion, and say that countries get to decide if they want railroads going to their country.

Spartan from TIU proposes that next meeting, a global currency is decided.
